	HTML is the backbone of every webpage on the internet. It will provide you with the tools to create the bare bones of a website. HTML is a relatively simple language, and can be augmented by two other languages: JavaScript and CSS. In html, you have something called <i>tags</i>. Tags are the basic building blocks of HTML. Individual tags can even be customized using <i>attributes</i>. Here is an example of a complete tag:
	</br>
	<code><xmp><font color="red">Hello!</font></xmp></code>
	</br>
	<code>font</code> is the tag. <code>color</code> is an attribute. Attributes are always set to be equal to a string. "Hello!" is what's called the content.
	</br></br>
	<heading><u>Common HTML Tags</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	<xmp>•<html> - Every other tag in your webpage must come between <html> and </html>.</xmp>
	<xmp>•<title></title> - whatever you type between these tags will be set as the webpage's tab name.</xmp>
	<xmp>•<body> - most of your html code will be within a <body> tag. <body> represents the background of your webpage.</xmp>
	<xmp>•<p> - sets apart text within the tag as a single paragraph.</xmp>
	<xmp>•<font> - uses attributes to change some text's color, font size, and decoration.</xmp>
	<xmp>•</br> - </br> doesn't require a <br> tag. It tells the webpage to skip down to the next time.</xmp>
	<xmp>•<a> - the attributes to this tag define a link.</xmp>
	<xmp>•<img> - adds an image to your webpage.</xmp>
	<xmp>•<canvas> - canvas is a tag used to draw graphics with javascript. It is used to make graphical games on a webpage.</xmp>

	<title>Webpage example</title>
	<body background="skyBlue">
		<!--P.S., here's a comment. Comments don't affect the webpage in any way, they're just here as notes-->
		<h1>Here's a heading</h1>
		text outside of any tag shows up as just plain text on a webpage.</br>
		<!--You'll want a </br> (a break tag) after plain text to indent to the next line on the page after it-->
		<font size="6" color="red">Big red text!</font>
		</br>
		<a href="bit.ly/erhscompclub">A link to the best webpage ever :P</a>
		<p>Here's a paragraph. It will already be indented without a break tag because it's a paragraph. 
			HTML already handles that for us.</p>
