	<code><xmp>
		<body onclick="click(event)"></body>
		function click(e){
			alert(e.x,e.y);
		}
	</xmp></code>
	<code>onclick</code> is an attribute for the body tag. This attribute activates the code in quotes when the mouse clicks on the body tag. The body tag usually comprises most of a webpage, so this onclick will work wherever you click. The code in quotes is the function <code>click(e)</code>, and <code>event</code> is passed as its parameter. For this code to work, we must define the <code>click(e)</code> function with a parameter for event to be passed in to. <code>event</code> is a built-in feature of javascript, and returns data for a special recent event (such as a mouse click). Now let's look at our <code>click(e)</code> function. This function will open a popup box with the coordinates of your click. To check what point was clicked on a page, simply call <code>e.x</code> or <code>e.y</code>, for the x and y coordinate respectively.
	</br></br>
	<b><u>Using Clicks with Canvas</u></b>
	</br>
	Calling <code>e.x</code> or <code>e.y</code> will return the coordinates of a mouse click with respect to the HTML tag whose onclick function was called. The coordinate (0,0) is the very upper-left corner of a tag. If you add an <code>onclick</code> attribute to a canvas tag, then the click coordinates will directly fall on the coordinate system used to draw on the canvas. That means that if you click on a picture in the canvas, you can compare <code>e</code>'s coordinates to the picture's coordinates and they will overlap. You can check to see if a picture on the canvas was clicked like this:
	<code><xmp>
		function wasClicked(pic,e){
			if(e.x>=pic.x && e.x<=pic.x+pic.width){
				if(e.y>=pic.y && e.y<=pic.y+pic.height){
					return true;
				}
			}
			return false;
		}
	</xmp></code>
	What this function does is that it checks to see whether e.x is between <code>pic</code>'s left side (<code>pic.x</code>) and its right side (<code>pic</code>'s left side plus its width). If it is, then the code can then check to make sure <code>e.y</code> is between pic's top side and bottom side. If so, then that means that <code>e</code>'s coordinates fall somewhere within <code>pic</code>, so the user must have clicked on <code>pic</code>. The function will return <code>true</code> if <code>pic</code> was clicked on, and <code>false</code> if it was not.
