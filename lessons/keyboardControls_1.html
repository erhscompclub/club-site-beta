	<heading><u>Console</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	The console is a programmer's main way to access how a computer 'thinks'. In essence, it is a testing ground for webpages. From the console, programmers can run new code from their webpage, check the values of pre-existing variables, and read data printed from the website. Let's take a look at how to do all these tasks.

	<b><u>Accessing the Console</u></b></br>
	Before you can do anything on the console, however, you must know how to access it. How you go about doing this differs slightly from browser to browser, so I recommend you google it for whichever browser you're using.
	</br></br>
	<b><u>Printing to the Console</u></b></br>
	Programmers often print messages to the console. This can come in handy if the programmer wants to know the value of a variable at a certain point in the code, or if the programmer wants to know if a certain section of code was even executed. To print to the console, you type this:
	</br></br>
	<code>
		console.log("Booty poppin'");
	</code>
	</br></br>
	This will cause your message (passed as a parameter into the <code>console.log()</code> function) to appear in the console.
	</br></br>
	<b><u>Running Code/Accessing Variables</u></b></br>
	From the console you can check the value of variables, as well as run new code in your program. To run any code in the console, just type it as you would in Javascript. For example, try typing <code>alert('Rare Pepes.')</code> into the console and hit enter. What happens is exactly what you would get if you added that code to your webpage in the first place. This is a powerful tool that allows developers to experiment with their webpages without having to go back and rewrite code all the time. To check the value of a variable, simply type the variable's name in the console and hit enter. The console will return the value of the variable in question. Try creating a new variable in the console with <code>var alex="Awesome"</code>. Then, type <code>alex</code>, hit enter, and watch as the console returns "Awesome". You can also access class data from the console. For example, create a new class called "Person" with parameter "name" and initialize a new instance of that class. Give it whatever name you'd like. Then, run your program and go to the console. Type in the variable name of your instance of person, a dot, and "name". The console should return the string value of your person's name (whatever you passed as its name parameter). The console is a programmer's best friend, giving him/her access to data he might not otherwise know within the program. A form of the console exists for nearly all programming languages, so it is immensely useful for a programmer to understand how to use it.
