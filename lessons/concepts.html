	<heading><u>Basic Programming Concepts</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	There are hundreds of programming languages you could learn. Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ActionScript, PHP, Haskell, the C languages, and many, many more. Most languages were created with a certain goal in mind. For example, HTML is used to create the bare bones of a webpage, CSS beautifies those bones, and JavaScript adds functionality to the page (required for games). Java can create Android or desktop apps, and ActionScript is used for Flash games. To fill so many varied purposes, different programming languages often have many differences between them. However, there are a few aspects that are present in most relevant modern programming languages.

	<heading><u>Comments</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	Sometimes in programming you want to temporarily "delete" code to see what would happen without it. Or maybe you want to leave tips or explanations for fellow programmers working on the same project as you, to explain what your functions or variables are for. Or maybe you're like me and leave half-written chapters of Computer Club history hidden in the code of the webpage ;D. At any rate, you can achieve all of these with comments. Comments mark a section of your code so the program ignores it when it is run, so they're perfect for leaving messages for programmers only, or for removing small bits of code when testing your game. There are a few different types of comments, and some that can only be used in certain languages. Here are the three most common types of comments:
	</br>
	• //comment goes here. This type of comment is used in Javascript, Java, the C languages, and Actionscript. It only works for a single line.
	</br>
	• /*comment goes here*/ this kind of comment works in the same languages as the // comment, and also in CSS. It can extend for multiple lines.
	<xmp>•<!--comment goes here-->This is used in HTML. It functions like the /**/ comment above.</xmp>
	<heading><u>camelCase</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	Camel Case is a new way of writing sentences. The first word in the sentence is all lower-case. Every word after that has its first letter capitalized. Here's an example of Camel Case:</br>
		thisIsACamelCaseSentence</br>
	Camel Case is usually used when writing method or class names, because in most programming languages, a space between two words means that they are two different things, and not a single name. It's not necessary to use camel case as long as you don't put spaces between method names, class names, or variables...It's just the preferred way for programmers to name what they code.
	</br></br>
	<heading><u>Variables</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	Almost every programming language has something called a variable. Variables are just a way for you to store important information in the code...something that could possiby change while the code is running (like player health in a game). There are many different types of data that can be stored in a variable. Here's a quick list of the most popular data types:</br>
	• string: words, letters, numbers, or whatever in quotes; Ex: "Hello, there."</br>
	• integer: a whole number; Ex: 1,-20,0,15648</br>
	• boolean: a value that can only be true or false (Like whether or not a light switch is on)</br>
	</br>
	<heading><u>Math</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	Now that we're familiar with variables, let's talk about an even more fundamental concept in programming - math. Programming is essentially just a person telling a computer what math operations to do, and where to store the results. For example, all files (images, 3D models, songs, videos) are displayed on a computer screen and/or heard through computer speakers because the files are stored as (or converted into) numbers that tell the computer which RGB values to put at what position of the screen or that describe a sound wave that must be produced by the speakers. Now imagine a game, like Super Mario Bros. Mario's x and y positions on the screen, his speed in both dimensions, his current power-up, number of lives, and how many coins he has are all represented by numbers. Math (mainly addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) is how the programmer manipulates these numbers to get the game to progress and change.In almost all languages, addition is represented by +, subtraction by -, multiplication by *, and division by /. Here are a few examples of operations using variables in Javascript:
	</br>
	• health-=damage; //the = right after - means that the variable on the left becomes itself minus the variable on the right</br>
	• totalDamage=damage-armor; //an example of a basic minus operation</br>
	• force=mass*acceleration; //the basis of a physics engine in your game</br>
	• damage*=2; //perhaps you run this code when you get a 2x damage buff</br>
	</br>
	<heading><u>Methods</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	You know how in Algebra you're introduced to functions? Well, since many programming languages are heavily based on math concepts, they have functions as well. Some languages call them methods, behaviors, or simply just functions. They are all just different names used for the same thing. In essence, a function in math recieves data as an input, changes that data and then outputs the changes. Think of the simple function f(x)=2x+3. The function inputs x, multiplies it by 2, adds 3, and then returns that value. In mathematics functions return numbers, usually for display on a graph. In programming, however, that's not always the case. Sure a function can return numerical, string, boolean or other data types, but it doesn't always have to. Some functions are just snippets of code that do stuff but don't return any value. This means that all you have to do to run that snippet of code is to "call" the function. Without the function, you would have to copy and paste all the code somewhere else to run it in multiple places. Functions simplify that by allowing you to refer back to that snippet of code from anywhere else in your program. Now, I'll explain one more thing: what does it mean to "call" a function? Well, functions have parameters (inputs, such as x), a return value, and a name. Where as the parameters and return value are optional, all functions have at least a name. In all languages, you call a function by typing its name (though most languages require you to type a few other things such as parenthesis for syntax purposes). If you call a function somewhere in your code, the code within the function itself will be run as if you had typed it all in place of your function call. Think of a function as a macro (for those of you familiar with gaming terms) or a custom command that you specify yourself. Most programming languages come with built-in functions and allow you to make your own. There is a more specific guide on functions in Javascript in the Javascript lesson.

	<heading><u>Keywords</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	All programming languages come with built-in <i>keywords</i>. To explain what keywords are I suppose I'll have to explain how programming languages themselves work. Once you've written all your code, you "run" your program. Different languages are designed to code different things, and so are run on different platforms. Javascript is designed for web development, and so is run in a browser, while C runs from the command line to make executable .exe files. When a program is run, the language's compiler scans through all your code and translates it into lower and lower-level languages (the lower a language's level is, the closer it is to pure binary code). This series of translation doesn't stop until your code is pure binary (usually). Computers can't truly understand our programming languages, only binary code. Humans, however, find it hard to read binary so we created compilers and programming languages. All languages have basic, fundamental commands and phrases. These are called keywords, and they let the compiler know what exactly your code is doing so it can make an accurate translation down to binary. Keywords can vary drastically between languages. In Javascript, the <code>var</code> lets the compiler know you are making a variable. In Ruby, <code>puts</code> tells the compiler you want to display some text. In most languages, the <code>return</code> keyword tells the compiler to exit a function with a specified output. You will learn more about keywords as you learn individual languages, such as Javascript.
